#+TITLE: Rofi configuration

*I've completely updated my configuration disregard this README.* You can find old configrations at [[https://github.com/Alcadramin/Dots/tree/main/.config/rofi/DEPRECATED]]

 - Navy and Ivory is for *Rofi 1.5.4* won't work correctly with *Rofi >1.6.0* if you have latest version use *Navy and Ivory Next*.

I've several themes here but mainly using *Navy and Ivory* one which you can check out in ~themes/~ folder. This theme has 3 modes:
 - drun
 - Emoji Selector ([[https://github.com/fdw/rofimoji][Rofimoji]])
 - Powermenu
