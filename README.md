I casually distro hopping and I need a quick solution so..

- If your system is **Debian** or **Arch** based you can ~~directly run [`setup.sh`](setup.sh)~~ (**script is outdated use with caution**) from your terminal, it will guide you through and automatically install apps & load dotfiles with your choices.
- If it's not, unfortunately you have to install these applications by hand and manually copy the files to your home directory.

* My configurations are heavily depends on [Nerd Fonts](https://www.nerdfonts.com/) please install all of them in advance, or you will see weird fonts üòì

#
### [`setup.sh`](setup.sh) is capable of: ‚ú®

**!!THIS SCRIPT IS OUTDATED USE WITH CAUTION!!**

- [x] Automatically detect your package manager and your OS.
- [x] Copy dotfiles to your home directory.
- [x] Install dependencies.
- [x] Install **Window Manager** after your choice (will prompt you a dialog).
- [x] Install **Terminal Emulator** after your choice (will prompt you a dialog).
- [ ] Install **Text Editor** after your choice. <kbd>not yet</kbd>
- [ ] Install and setup **zsh** & **oh-my-zsh**. <kbd>not yet</kbd>

If you have something in your mind and/or don't know shell scripting. Open an issue i'll take a look.
