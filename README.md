I casually distro hopping and I need a quick solution so..

- If your system is **Debian** or **Arch** based you can directly run [`setupEnvironment.sh`](setupEnvironment.sh) from your terminal, it will guide you through and automatically install apps & load dotfiles with your choices.

- If it's not unfortunately you have to install these applications by hand and manually copy the files to your home directory.

#
### [`setupEnvironment.sh`](setupEnvironment.sh) is capable of: ‚ú®

- [x] Automatically detect your package manager and your OS.
- [x] Install dependencies.
- [x] Install **Window Manager** after your choice (will prompt you a dialog).
- [x] Install **Terminal Emulator** after your choice (will prompt you a dialog).
- [ ] Install **Text Editor** after your choice. <kbd>not yet</kbd>
- [ ] Install and setup **zsh** & **oh-my-zsh**. <kbd>not yet</kbd>
- [x] Copy dotfiles to your home directory.

If you have something in your mind and don't know shell scripting. Open an issue i'll take a look.
